This application is intended for a shoe company to use internally to track various shoe brands and the stores at which each brand is sold. The application can store multiple shoe brands and multiple shoe stores and practices a many-to-many relationship.

The application contains two database tables: brands and stores. This application uses RESTFUL routing.

The following MVP user story requirements have been met for this application:

* As a user, I want to be able to add, update, delete and list shoe stores.
* As a user, I want to be able to add and list new shoe brands. Shoe brands should include price.
* As a user, I want to be able to add shoe brands in the application (don't worry about updating, listing or destroying shoe brands).
* As a user, I want to be able to add existing shoe brands to a store to show where they are sold.
* As a user, I want to be able to associate the same brand of shoes with multiple stores.
* As a user, I want to be able to see all of the brands a store sells on the individual store page.
* As a user, I want store names and shoe brands to be saved with a capital letter no matter how I enter them.
* As a user, I want the price to be in currency format even if I just inputted a number. (In other words, typing in 50 should be updated to $50.00.)
* As a user, I do not want stores and/or shoe brands to be saved if I enter a blank name.
* As a user, I want all stores and brands to be unique. There shouldn't be two entries in the database for Blundstone.

The following additional user stories have been met:
* As a user, I want to be able to remove brands from a store.
